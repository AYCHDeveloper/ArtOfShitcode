## The Principles

### 💩 Name variables in a way like your code is already obfuscated.

Good 👍🏻:

```javascript
let a = 42;
```

Bad 👎🏻:

```javascript
let age = 42
```

### 💩 Always write comments in your local language.

You don’t want it to be readable by oversees teams.

👍🏻 Good:

```javascript
// Обновляем состояние компонента
setAge(42)
```

👎🏻 Bad:

```javascript
// Update component state
setAge(42)
```
